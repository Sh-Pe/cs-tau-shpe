# Computer Science notes & etc. at Tel-Aviv University by Shahar Perets
My documents for computer science degree in Tel-Aviv University, together with Odyssey program.

Courses has been done in Hebrew unless noted otherwise.  

Folders stracture: 
- hw: homeworks
- scs: Shit Cheat Sheets
- lec: lecture notes
- other: may be added if needed
- pt: usually practices

Each folder contains subfolders, and in each subfolder exists a .tex file and a corresponding complied .pdf file. 
My current compiler is LuaLaTeX. Required packges & premable are attached to each .tex document (so automatic compiling with MikTeX should just work). Older files may use XeLaTeX.

**Huge thanks for all of the developers putting their own time and effort into making free and open source applications.** This software that I use on a daily basis, includes: 
- Document making: LaTeX, LuaLaTeX, TeXStudio, MikTeX (+LibreOffice in the past)
- Desktop: Hyprland, Arch Linux, The Linux kernel
- Apps I use on a daily basis making those documents: kvantum, KDE (in particular, okular, kate, gwenview, dolphin, and what not), Mozilla Firefox, Kitty (terminal emulator)

 And thoustands of other packges that are being used as a dependency of a dependency of a dependency that I'm not even aware of, but probably some developer put years of work into them.
